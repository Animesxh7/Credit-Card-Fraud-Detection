# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This repository contains a single dataset that has been split into
six smaller CSV files to comply with GitHub file size limits.

All six files together represent the complete original dataset.
No rows or columns have been modified during the split process.

------------------------------------------------------------

How the Data Was Split

• The original dataset was too large to upload as a single file.
• The data was split row-wise into six equal parts.
• Each CSV file contains the same column structure.
• Header row is included in every file.
